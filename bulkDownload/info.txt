I have primarily used Instacollector on both desktop and mobile devices. 
On mobile, I had to use a Python coding application, specifically PyDroid 3, on an Android test phone. 
For PyDroid 3, I configured the settings to use "Public documents" as the storage location 
for the script and where all the downloads would occur.
While both desktop and mobile devices can be used with Instacollector, 
I recommend using desktop for large downloads. However, it is worth noting that both options can work. 
Mobile devices may present challenges such as app exits or screen timeouts, 
but they are still viable for using Instacollector.
